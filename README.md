=======

When programs get big, it is necessary to split them into multiple files.  A common way to do this in JavaScript is using the Module Pattern (one of many design patterns).  For interactive graphical programs, a “best practice” for dividing the concerns of the modules is the Model View Controller paradigm.  Today we’ll take the grapher code, separate it into modules, and develop further features for it.
